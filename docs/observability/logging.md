# Dynamo Logging

## Overview

Dynamo provides structured logging in both text as well as JSONL. When
JSONL is enabled, logs support `trace_id` and `span_id` fields for
distributed tracing. Span creation and exit events can be optionally
enabled via the `DYN_LOGGING_SPAN_EVENTS` environment variable.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `DYN_LOGGING_JSONL` | Enable JSONL logging format | `false` | `true` |
| `DYN_LOGGING_SPAN_EVENTS` | Enable span entry/close event logging (`SPAN_FIRST_ENTRY`, `SPAN_CLOSED` messages) | `false` | `true` |
| `DYN_LOG` | Log levels per target `<default_level>,<module_path>=<level>,<module_path>=<level>` | `info` | `DYN_LOG=info,dynamo_runtime::system_status_server:trace` |
| `DYN_LOG_USE_LOCAL_TZ` | Use local timezone for timestamps (default is UTC) | `false` | `true` |
| `DYN_LOGGING_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to custom TOML logging configuration | none | `/path/to/config.toml` |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | Service name for trace and span information | `dynamo` | `dynamo-frontend` |
| `OTEL_EXPORT_ENABLED` | Enable OTLP trace exporting | `false` | `true` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | OTLP exporter endpoint | `http://localhost:4317` | `http://tempo:4317` |

## Getting Started Quickly

### Start Observability Stack

For collecting and visualizing logs with Grafana Loki (Kubernetes), or viewing trace context in logs alongside Grafana Tempo, start the observability stack. See [Observability Getting Started](README.md#getting-started-quickly) for instructions.

### Enable Structured Logging

Enable structured JSONL logging:

```bash
export DYN_LOGGING_JSONL=true
export DYN_LOG=debug

# Start your Dynamo components (default port 8000, override with --http-port or DYN_HTTP_PORT env var)
python -m dynamo.frontend &
python -m dynamo.vllm --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --enforce-eager &
```

Logs will be written to stderr in JSONL format with trace context.

## Available Logging Levels

| **Logging Levels (Least to Most Verbose)** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ERROR**                                 | Critical errors (e.g., unrecoverable failures, resource exhaustion)              |
| **WARN**                                  | Unexpected or degraded situations (e.g., retries, recoverable errors)           |
| **INFO**                                  | Operational information (e.g., startup/shutdown, major events)                 |
| **DEBUG**                                 | General debugging information (e.g., variable values, flow control)            |
| **TRACE**                                 | Very low-level, detailed information (e.g., internal algorithm steps)           |

```

## Logging of Trace and Span IDs

When `DYN_LOGGING_JSONL` is enabled, all logs include `trace_id` and `span_id` fields, and spans are automatically created for requests. This is useful for short debugging sessions where you want to examine trace context in logs without setting up a full tracing backend and for correlating log messages with traces.

The trace and span information uses the OpenTelemetry format and libraries, which means the IDs are compatible with OpenTelemetry-based tracing backends like Tempo or Jaeger if you later choose to enable trace export.

**Note:** This section has overlap with [Distributed Tracing with Tempo](tracing.md). For trace visualization in Grafana Tempo and persistent trace analysis, see [Distributed Tracing with Tempo](tracing.md).

### Configuration for Logging

To see trace information in logs:

```bash
export DYN_LOGGING_JSONL=true
export DYN_LOG=debug  # Set to debug to see detailed trace logs

# Start your Dynamo components (e.g., frontend and worker) (default port 8000, override with --http-port or DYN_HTTP_PORT env var)
python -m dynamo.frontend &
python -m dynamo.vllm --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --enforce-eager &
```

This enables JSONL logging with `trace_id` and `span_id` fields. Traces appear in logs but are not exported to any backend.

### Example Request

Send a request to generate logs with trace context:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-request-id: test-trace-001' \
-d '{
  "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
  "max_completion_tokens": 100,
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
  ]
}' \
http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions
```

Check the logs (stderr) for JSONL output containing `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `x_request_id` fields.

## Trace and Span Information in Logs

This section shows how trace and span information appears in JSONL logs. These logs can be used to understand request flows even without a trace visualization backend.

### Example Disaggregated Trace in Grafana

When viewing the corresponding trace in Grafana, you should be able to see something like the following:

![Disaggregated Trace Example](grafana-disagg-trace.png)
### Trace Overview

Dynamo creates distributed traces that span across multiple services in a disaggregated serving setup. The following sections describe the key spans you'll see in Grafana when viewing traces for chat completion requests.

#### Available Spans in Disaggregated Mode

When running Dynamo in disaggregated mode, a typical request creates the following spans:

##### 1. `http-request` (Frontend - Root Span)

The root span for the entire request lifecycle, created in the **dynamo-frontend** service.

**Key Attributes:**
- **Service**: `dynamo-frontend`
- **Operation**: Handles the HTTP request from client to completion
- **Duration**: Total end-to-end request time (includes prefill + decode)
- **Method**: HTTP method (typically `POST`)
- **URI**: Request endpoint (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`)
- **Status**: Request completion status
- **Children**: Typically 2-3 child spans (routing span + worker spans)

This span represents the complete request flow from when the frontend receives the HTTP request until the final response is sent back to the client.

##### 2. `prefill_routing` (Frontend - Routing Span)

A child span of `http-request`, created in the **dynamo-frontend** service during the routing phase.

**Key Attributes:**
- **Service**: `dynamo-frontend`
- **Operation**: Routes the prefill request to an appropriate prefill worker
- **Duration**: Time spent selecting and the span of prefill.
- **Parent**: `http-request` span

This span captures the routing logic and decision-making process and the request sent to the prefill worker.

##### 3. `handle_payload` (Prefill Worker Span)

A child span of `http-request`, created in the **dynamo-worker-vllm-prefill** service.

**Key Attributes:**
- **Service**: `dynamo-worker-vllm-prefill` (or `dynamo-worker-sglang-prefill` for SGLang)
- **Operation**: Processes the prefill phase of generation
- **Duration**: Time to compute prefill (typically milliseconds to seconds)
- **Component**: `prefill`
- **Endpoint**: `generate`
- **Parent**: `http-request` span

This span represents the actual prefill computation on a prefill-specialized worker, including prompt processing and initial KV cache generation.

##### 4. `handle_payload` (Decode Worker Span)

A child span of `http-request`, created in the **dynamo-worker-vllm-decode** service.

**Key Attributes:**
- **Service**: `dynamo-worker-vllm-decode` (or `dynamo-worker-sglang-decode` for SGLang)
- **Operation**: Processes the decode phase of generation
- **Duration**: Time to generate all output tokens (typically seconds)
- **Component**: `decode` or `backend`
- **Endpoint**: `generate`
- **Parent**: `http-request` span

This span represents the iterative token generation phase on a decode-specialized worker, which consumes the KV cache from prefill and produces output tokens.


#### Understanding Span Metrics

Each span provides several useful metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Duration** | Total time from span start to end |
| **Busy Time** | Time actively processing (excluding waiting) |
| **Idle Time** | Time spent waiting (e.g., for network, other services) |
| **Start Time** | When the span began |
| **Child Count** | Number of direct child spans |

The relationship **Duration = Busy Time + Idle Time** helps identify where time is spent and potential bottlenecks.

## Custom Request IDs in Logs

You can provide a custom request ID using the `x-request-id` header. This ID will be attached to all spans and logs for that request, making it easier to correlate traces with application-level request tracking.

### Example Request with Custom Request ID

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-request-id: 8372eac7-5f43-4d76-beca-0a94cfb311d0' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain why Roger Federer is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time"
      }
    ],
    "stream": false,
    "max_tokens": 1000
  }'
```

All spans and logs for this request will include the `x_request_id` attribute with value `8372eac7-5f43-4d76-beca-0a94cfb311d0`.

### Frontend Logs with Custom Request ID

Notice how the `x_request_id` field appears in all log entries, alongside the `trace_id` (`80196f3e3a6fdf06d23bb9ada3788518`) and `span_id`:
